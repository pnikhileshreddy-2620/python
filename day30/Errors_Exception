In Python, **Errors** and **Exceptions** are important concepts. Since you’re learning Python seriously to become a developer, understanding this clearly is very important.

---

# 1️⃣ What is an Error in Python?

An **error** is a problem in your program that stops execution.

There are mainly **2 types**:

## 🔹 1. Syntax Errors

Happen when Python rules are broken.

```python
if x > 5
    print("Hello")
```

❌ Missing `:` → SyntaxError

These are detected **before** program execution.

---

## 🔹 2. Exceptions (Runtime Errors)

These happen **while the program is running**.

Example:

```python
a = 10
b = 0
print(a / b)
```

❌ Output:

```
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Program crashes if not handled.

---

# 2️⃣ Common Built-in Exceptions

| Exception           | When it Happens           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `ZeroDivisionError` | Dividing by zero          |
| `ValueError`        | Wrong value type          |
| `TypeError`         | Wrong data type operation |
| `IndexError`        | Index out of range        |
| `KeyError`          | Dictionary key not found  |
| `FileNotFoundError` | File not found            |

Example:

```python
num = int("abc")
```

❌ ValueError

---

# 3️⃣ Exception Handling in Python

Python uses:

```
try
except
else
finally
```

---

## ✅ Basic Syntax

```python
try:
    # risky code
except ExceptionType:
    # handling code
```

---

## 🔹 Example 1: Handling ZeroDivisionError

```python
try:
    a = 10
    b = 0
    print(a / b)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero")
```

✔ Program will not crash.

---

## 🔹 Example 2: Handling Multiple Exceptions

```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(result)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Number cannot be zero")

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Enter only numbers.")
```

---

## 🔹 Example 3: Using Generic Exception

```python
try:
    x = int("abc")
except Exception as e:
    print("Error occurred:", e)
```

`e` stores the error message.

---

# 4️⃣ else Block

Runs only if no exception occurs.

```python
try:
    a = 10
    b = 2
    print(a / b)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide")
else:
    print("Division successful")
```

---

# 5️⃣ finally Block

Runs **always**, whether exception occurs or not.

```python
try:
    f = open("file.txt")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
finally:
    print("Done")
```

Used mostly for:

* Closing files
* Closing database connections
* Cleaning resources

---

# 6️⃣ Raising Custom Exceptions

You can create your own exception.

```python
age = 15

if age < 18:
    raise ValueError("Age must be 18 or above")
```

---

# 7️⃣ Creating Custom Exception Class

```python
class MyError(Exception):
    pass

raise MyError("Something went wrong")
```

---

# 8️⃣ Best Practices (Very Important)

✅ Catch specific exceptions
✅ Don’t use bare `except:`
✅ Use finally for cleanup
✅ Keep try block small
✅ Log errors in real applications

---

# 🔥 Real Developer Example (File Handling)

```python
try:
    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist")

except PermissionError:
    print("No permission to read file")

except Exception as e:
    print("Unexpected error:", e)
```

# 🎯 Interview Important Points

* Syntax errors vs Exceptions
* try-except flow
* finally purpose
* Custom exceptions
* Difference between `Exception` and specific exceptions
