Debugging in programming is the process of finding, understanding, and fixing errors (called “bugs”) in code 🐛💻.

When you write a program, things don’t always work the way you expect. Debugging is how you figure out why.
What counts as a bug?


Syntax errors – typos or grammar mistakes (missing semicolons, wrong indentation, etc.)


Runtime errors – the program crashes while running (like dividing by zero)


Logic errors – the program runs, but gives the wrong result (the trickiest kind)


What does debugging usually involve?


Reading error messages carefully


Running the code step by step to see what’s happening


Printing values to check what variables contain


Using a debugger tool to pause, inspect, and move through code line by line


Testing different inputs to spot patterns


Simple example
x = 10
y = 0
print(x / y)

This crashes. Debugging means realizing: “Oh, I’m dividing by zero,” and then fixing it.
Why debugging matters


1.describe the problem
2. what is the error.
3.program except input data ,what data type use is giving to program
