Code blocks in Python
A code block is a group of statements that belong together
indentation (spaces)
if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
    print("This line is also in the block")
Key rules:
A colon : starts a block
All lines in the block must be indented the same amount
Usually 4 spaces (standard practice)

Blocks appear in:
if / elif / else
while, for
functions
classes

Functions in Python
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
Why use functions?
Avoid repeating code
Make programs easier to read
Break big problems into smaller ones

def greet():
    print("Hello!")
greet()

while loop in Python
A while loop repeats code as long as a condition is true.
