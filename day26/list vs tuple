## 🔹 Tuple vs List in Python

Both **tuples** and **lists** store multiple items in Python, but they have important differences.

---

# 1️⃣ List

A **list** is an ordered, **mutable** (changeable) collection.

### ✅ Syntax

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

### ✅ You can modify it

```python
my_list[0] = 10
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)   # [10, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

# 2️⃣ Tuple

A **tuple** is an ordered, **immutable** (unchangeable) collection.

### ✅ Syntax

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

### ❌ You cannot modify it

```python
my_tuple[0] = 10   # ❌ Error
```

# 🔥 Key Differences

| Feature     | List             | Tuple            |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Syntax      | `[ ]`            | `( )`            |
| Mutable     | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No             |
| Performance | Slightly slower  | Slightly faster  |
| Memory      | Uses more memory | Uses less memory |
| Methods     | Many             | Few              |

---

# 🔹 List Methods (Common)

```python
append()
extend()
insert()
remove()
pop()
sort()
reverse()
clear()
```

---

# 🔹 Tuple Methods (Only 2!)

```python
count()
index()
```

Example:

```python
t = (1, 2, 2, 3)
print(t.count(2))   # 2
print(t.index(3))   # 3
```

---

# 🚀 When to Use What?

### ✅ Use List when:

* Data needs to change
* You need many built-in methods
* You are storing dynamic data

Example:

```python
shopping_cart = ["milk", "bread"]
shopping_cart.append("eggs")
```

---

### ✅ Use Tuple when:

* Data should NOT change
* Fixed data (like coordinates)
* You want better performance

Example:

```python
coordinates = (10.5, 20.3)
```

---

# 🎯 Simple Rule to Remember

👉 **List = Changeable**
👉 **Tuple = Fixed**
