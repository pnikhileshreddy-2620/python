Higher-order functions (often what people mean by “high order”)

A higher-order function is a function that does at least one of these:

Takes another function as an argument

Returns a function

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"

def shout(func):
    # func is another function
    return func("Alice").upper()

print(shout(greet))

ex:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

squared = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))
filtered = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

map, filter, and sorted are all higher-order functions because they accept functions.

Returning a function
def multiplier(n):
    def inner(x):
        return x * n
    return inner

double = multiplier(2)
print(double(5))  # 10

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Higher-order function | A function that works with other functions                               |
| Event listener        | A function that reacts to an event                                       |
| Callback              | A function passed to be called later                                     |
| Relationship          | Event listeners are usually callbacks passed into higher-order functions |
