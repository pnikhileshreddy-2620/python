An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows two different software programs to communicate and exchange data with each other.
It acts as a messenger or a middleman, receiving requests from one application (the client) and delivering a response from another (the server).

An api is a set of rules and protocols functions and objects.That programmers can use to create software or interact with external system.


Sure 👍
Here are **clean, interview-ready notes** on **HTTP Response Codes**.

---

# 📘 HTTP Response Codes – Notes

## ✅ 1. What is a Response Code?

* A **response code** (HTTP status code) is a number returned by the server.
* It tells whether the request was:

  * Successful ✅
  * Failed ❌
  * Redirected 🔁

---

# 📊 2. Categories of HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are divided into **5 categories**:

| Range | Meaning       |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 1xx   | Informational |
| 2xx   | Success       |
| 3xx   | Redirection   |
| 4xx   | Client Error  |
| 5xx   | Server Error  |

---

# 🟢 3. 2xx – Success Codes

| Code | Meaning    | When Used                    |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| 200  | OK         | Request successful           |
| 201  | Created    | New resource created         |
| 204  | No Content | Success but no response body |

Example:

* GET → 200
* POST (create user) → 201

---

# 🟡 4. 3xx – Redirection Codes

| Code | Meaning            |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| 301  | Moved Permanently  |
| 302  | Temporary Redirect |

Used when:

* URL has changed
* Resource moved

---

# 🔴 5. 4xx – Client Errors

Means: ❌ Problem in request (Client mistake)

| Code | Meaning      | Reason             |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 400  | Bad Request  | Invalid input      |
| 401  | Unauthorized | Login required     |
| 403  | Forbidden    | No permission      |
| 404  | Not Found    | Resource not found |

Example:

* Wrong API URL → 404
* Wrong credentials → 401

---

# 🔥 6. 5xx – Server Errors

Means: ❌ Server problem

| Code | Meaning               |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 500  | Internal Server Error |
| 502  | Bad Gateway           |
| 503  | Service Unavailable   |

Example:

* Database crash → 500

---

# 💻 Python Example

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://localhost:8080/products")

print(response.status_code)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Error")
```

---

# 🧠 Important Interview Points

* 200 → Success
* 201 → Resource Created
* 400 → Client mistake
* 401 → Authentication required
* 403 → Access denied
* 404 → Not found
* 500 → Server error

---

# 🎯 Short Interview Definition

> HTTP status codes are standard response codes returned by a server to indicate the result of an HTTP request.
