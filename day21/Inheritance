Inheritance in programming is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a new class (called a child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called a parent or superclass).
 This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.


 # Parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

# Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Usage
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.name)      # Output: Buddy (inherited from Animal)
print(dog.speak())   # Output: Woof! (overridden method)
print(cat.speak())   # Output: Meow!
