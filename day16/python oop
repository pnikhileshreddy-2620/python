How Python achieves OOP concepts
1️⃣ Class & Object (base of OOP)

Real life:
Class = Blueprint
Object = Real thing made from it

class Car:
    def start(self):
        print("Car started")

my_car = Car()   # object
my_car.start()
Python uses the class keyword to create classes
👉 Objects are created by calling the class

2️⃣ Encapsulation (data protection)
Real life:
ATM machine → you can withdraw money, but you can’t touch cash inside

In Python:
Real life:
ATM machine → you can withdraw money, but you can’t touch cash inside
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance   # private variable

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
__balance is private

Access only through methods

👉 Python achieves encapsulation using:

Access modifiers (_, __)

Getter & setter methods

3️⃣ Inheritance (reusability)

Real life:
Child inherits features from parents

class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle started")

class Car(Vehicle):
    pass

c = Car()
c.start()
Car automatically gets start() from Vehicle
4️⃣ Polymorphism (many forms)

Real life:
Same word “run”:

run a program

run a race

In Python:
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow")

animals = [Dog(), Cat()]

for a in animals:
    a.sound()
5️⃣ Abstraction (hide complexity)

Real life:
Car pedals → you drive, you don’t know engine logic
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass


------------------------------------------------------------
Important Python OOP features

self → refers to current object

__init__() → constructor

Dynamic typing

Multiple inheritance



example of oops

cars
hotel
drones


object :-what is has,what it does
example waiter
what is has plates
what it does given food

object having attributes, methods

attributes is variable
methods is behaviours

creating object

obj =classname()
