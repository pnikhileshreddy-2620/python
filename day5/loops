What is a loop?
A loop is a way to repeat a block of code multiple times without writing it again and again.

Why do we use loops?
We use loops when:
You want to repeat something many times
You’re working with lists, strings, numbers
You don’t know in advance how many times something will run.

Types of loops in Python
Python mainly has two loops:
🔹 for loop
Used when you know how many times to repeat
🔹 while loop
Used when you don’t know how many times to repeat

break and continue

Where are loops used in real life code?

Games (movement, score updates)

Websites (user input validation)

Data analysis (processing thousands of rows)

Automation scripts

AI / Machine Learning training.


Simple rule to remember

🟢 Use for → when you know how many times
🟡 Use while → when you don’t know how many times
