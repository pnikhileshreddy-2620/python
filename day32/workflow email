Email works a lot like sending a digital letter — but instead of trucks and planes, it uses servers and the internet. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works behind the scenes:

---

## 1️⃣ You Write and Send the Email

You compose a message in an email app like **Gmail**, **Microsoft Outlook**, or **Apple Mail**.

When you hit **Send**, your email client connects to an outgoing mail server using a protocol called:

* **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

SMTP’s job is to send your message out to the internet.

---

## 2️⃣ Finding the Recipient’s Mail Server

Your outgoing mail server looks at the recipient’s email address.

Example:

```
name@example.com
```

It checks the domain (`example.com`) to find out which mail server handles email for that domain. It does this using the **Domain Name System (DNS)** — like the internet’s phonebook.

DNS records called **MX records** tell the server where to deliver the email.

---

## 3️⃣ Server-to-Server Transfer

Your mail server sends the message to the recipient’s mail server via SMTP.

If the receiving server is:

* ✅ Available → It accepts the message.
* ❌ Temporarily unavailable → It stores the message and retries later.

---

## 4️⃣ Storing the Email

The recipient’s mail server stores the message in their mailbox.

---

## 5️⃣ The Recipient Reads It

When the recipient opens their email app, it retrieves messages using one of these protocols:

* **IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol)
  → Keeps emails on the server (most common today)

* **POP3** (Post Office Protocol)
  → Downloads emails to one device

# 🔐 What About Security?

Modern email often uses:

* **TLS encryption** to protect messages in transit
* Spam filters
* Authentication methods like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to prevent spoofing
